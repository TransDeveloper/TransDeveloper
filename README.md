# TransDeveloper
### Hi there 👋🏻
I am a entrepreneur and software engineer. I currently work on FinnaCloud, an Enterprise Cloud Service Provider.
I've started programming at 9 years old, and It's almost been over 10 years since I started.

**Setup:** 
<ul>
    <li>
        16" MacBook Pro 2021 M1 Max 64GB 2TB (Space Gray)
    </li>
    <li>
        iPhone 14 Pro 256GB (Silver)
    </li>
    <li>
        AirPods Max (Space Gray)
    </li>
    <li>
        ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 (Black)
    </li>
</ul>
As you can see, I'm a big fan of Apple products. They have a great ecosystem and I love it.

### Programming Languages
I prefer using Java, PHP, JS and Python. I have experience with Cobol and Assembly.
